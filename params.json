{"name":"HaMMLET","tagline":"Fast Bayesian Hidden Markov Model with Wavelet Compression","body":"HaMMLET is a fast Forward-Backward Gibbs sampler for Bayesian inference on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). It uses the Haar wavelet transform to dynamically compress the data based on the current variance sample in each iteration. This yields speedup of up to two orders of magnitude on array CGH data, as well as vastly improved convergence characteristics. For details, please refer to the following preprint\r\n\r\n> John Wiedenhoeft, Eric Brugel, Alexander Schliep: \"Fast Bayesian Inference of Copy Number Variants using Hidden Markov Models with Wavelet Compression\". bioRxiv (2015).
